# Mini ECM project

__Note__: This project is work in progress.

This directory contains files that might some day lead to a mostly printable
electrochemical machining system (working with lower currents than most
industrial machines using only off the shelf and 3D printed parts)

## Parts

* An rigid 2 axis (XY) positioning system:
  * The fixed part is done in ([bedxy.jscad](./bedxy.jscad); work in progress)
  * The moveable sled ([xysled.jscad](./xysled.jscad); work in progress)
* Different tool mounts
  * A simple wire mount for typical tungsten welding electrodes ([headwire.jscad](./headwire.jscad); work in progress)
